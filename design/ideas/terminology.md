# Terminology

- **Case** - TBD
- **Evaluation** - measuring the suitability of an output. Not necessarily a scalar score - might be a vector of different metrics.
- **Journaling** - capturing the outputs or work product of potentially multi-step process, which really represents the work product of the process. The journal give insight into the semantics of the operation.
- **Logging** - capturing the telemetry exhaust that is produced as work it done. Focus is on diagnosing system operational issues that are not directly the work product in the user's domain.
- **Metric** - TBD
- **Turn** - TBD
