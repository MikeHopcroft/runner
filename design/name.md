# Tool Name

Proposal is an over-arching tool family name for the repo, combined with a toolset varient name,

### Tool Family Name Idea
- runner
- rover
- giraffe
- zebra

### Toolset Variant Name Ideas
- colors: red, green, blue
- elements from the periodic table
- mountain peaks
- rivers

### Some naming goals
- Easy to say
- Easy to type
- Catchy
- No negative connotations
- Fairly generic across cultures and markets
- Fairly neutral
- Not an obvious trademarked name in the domain
- Not an existing npm or pypi package name
- Variants are all related.

Varients do not need to imply an ordered sequence (e.g. elements form the periodic table or Greek characters).
